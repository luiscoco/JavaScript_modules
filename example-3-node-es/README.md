# ES6 imports

To use this syntax in Node.js, you need to give the file `.mjs` extension instead of `.js`,
or set `"type": "module"` field to `package.json`
(this will make it the default module system, and to use CommonJS you'll need to change file extension to `.cjs`

ES6 import system supports tree-shaking
ES6 import system supports cyclic dependencies

With ES Modules, imports are static, which means they are executed at parse time.
This is why imports are ‚Äúhoisted‚Äù. They are implicitly moved to the top of the file

- 'use strict' is always applied to modules
- if module is imported everal times, code is executed only once
- exported object is passed by reference to all importers
- import.meta contains information about current module (depends on environment, uusally url)
