Modules work only via HTTP(s), not locally

If you try to open a web-page locally, via file:// protocol, you’ll find that import/export directives don’t work.

Right-click on browser-modules.html in VS Code file explorer and select "Show Preview" command provided by ms-vscode.live-server extension to run local server and test modules.
